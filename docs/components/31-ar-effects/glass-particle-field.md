# GlassParticleField

## Overview
`GlassParticleField` is tracked in the AuraGlass historical certification inventory and participates in the glassmorphism visual certification workflow. This page provides direct component documentation coverage for the inventory item and links the component to its owner story, visual certification evidence, and implementation source.

## Inventory Metadata

- Category: misc
- Direct Storybook story: `src/components/immersive/GlassParticleField.stories.tsx`
- Certification report: `reports/glassmorphism-storybook-visual-certification.json`
- Certification screenshots: `reports/glassmorphism-storybook-visual-certification/screenshots`

## Source Paths

- `src/components/immersive/GlassParticleField.tsx`

## Glass Contract

- Render translucent glass surfaces with token-backed colors, blur, border, and elevation values.
- Preserve readable foreground contrast on glass backgrounds.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences for transitions, animation, and interactive feedback.
- Keep keyboard and pointer interactions visible through focus, hover, disabled, and loading states where applicable.

## Usage

```tsx
import { GlassParticleField } from 'aura-glass';

export function GlassParticleFieldExample() {
  return (
    <GlassParticleField aria-label="GlassParticleField example">
      GlassParticleField content
    </GlassParticleField>
  );
}
```

## Verification
