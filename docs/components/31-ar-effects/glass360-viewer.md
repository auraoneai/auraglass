# Glass360Viewer

## Overview

This page provides direct component documentation coverage for the inventory item and links the component to its owner story, visual certification evidence, and implementation source.

- Render translucent glass surfaces with token-backed colors, blur, border, and elevation values.
- Preserve readable foreground contrast on glass backgrounds.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences for transitions, animation, and interactive feedback.

import { Glass360Viewer } from 'aura-glass';

export function Glass360ViewerExample() {
  return (
    <Glass360Viewer aria-label="Glass360Viewer example">

    </Glass360Viewer>
  );
